# VanillaQOL: Vanilla but better
Series of modpacks made to make any version of minecraft the most it can be with **only client side** mods that can work on any **unmodded servers**.

## Installation steps

1. Install **one** of these three compatible launchers: [MultiMC](https://multimc.org/#Download), [PolyMC](https://polymc.org/download/) or [PrismLauncher](https://prismlauncher.org/download/). Also works with any forks of these launchers but these are the one I recommend.  
2. Install the instance of the **version** of Minecraft you want to play. 

|[1.21]()        | [More versions soon..]()                       |
|----------------|-------------------------------|


4. Click on **Add Instance** > **Import (from zip)** and select the .zip file you just downloaded. Click on **OK** and wait for the instance of VanillaQOL to appear on your launcher.
5. Click on the **instance**, and then click on the **Edit** button on the right. Go in **Settings** and then click on the checkmark for **Java Installation**. Click on **Auto-detect** and select the **version of java** depending on the version of VanillaQOL you installed. If the version of java you need doesn't appears in the list, install Java and restart the launcher.
